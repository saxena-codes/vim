# Lesson 5 - Execute External Commands, Writing Files and Copying content from another file

### 1. How to execute an external command.

- `:!command` executes an external command.
- Some useful examples are:
	- `!ls` - shows a directory listing.
	- `!rm FILENAME` - removes file FILENAME.

### 2. Writing Files

- `:w FILENAME` writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.

### 3. Retrieving and Merging Files

- `:r FILENAME` retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the cursor position.
